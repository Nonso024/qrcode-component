## **My process**

### **Built with**

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid

### **What I learned**

Well I got a better understanding of divs and styling them as well. I was also able to practicalise the use of flexbox and css grid.

**Code snippets**

```html
<div class="container">
  <img src="url for image" />
</div>
```

```css
.title {
  text-align: center;
}
```
