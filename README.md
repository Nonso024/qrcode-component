## **My process**

### **Built with**

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid

### **What I learned**

Well I got a better understanding of divs and styling them as well. I was also able to practicalise the use of flexbox and css grid.

**Code snippets**

```html
<div class="container">
  <img src="url for image" />
</div>
```

```css
.title {
  text-align: center;
}
```

### **Continued development**

Use this section to outline areas that you want to continue focusing on in future projects. These could be concepts you're still not completely comfortable with or techniques you found useful that you want to refine and perfect.
